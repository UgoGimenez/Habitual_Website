    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Habitual began in <strong>2021</strong> with a simple idea: provide a sustainable solution to the global sanitation crisis. Our founders, <strong>Marcos</strong> and <strong>Hugo</strong>, created the first <em>Jardín</em> prototype in 2022 and successfully sold it as a fully functional unit. Later that year, feedback and experimentation led to the <strong>Mini</strong> – a lightweight, flat‑packed MVP designed for easy transport and assembly.</p>
    <p>By <strong>2024</strong>, more than ten units were in use, and Marcos and Hugo relocated to Spain and Switzerland to bring Habitual to Europe. In <strong>2025</strong>, Habitual embarked on a new mission: helping humanitarian NGOs and governments deliver safe sanitation in disaster zones, refugee camps and remote communities. Our goal remains the same — to deliver dignity, hygiene and sustainability wherever it’s needed most.</p>
