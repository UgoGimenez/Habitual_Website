    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>How do I use the Mini module?</summary>
      <p>Use the Mini just like a conventional toilet; seating position is the same for men and women. The only difference is that there’s no flush—its integrated separator keeps urine and solid waste separate, so it doesn’t require any sewer connection.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What absorbent material should I use, and how much?</summary>
      <p>You can use sawdust, ash, wood shavings, sand, dry soil or rice husks—any compostable material with good absorption. After each bowel movement, add about 250 ml of material at the back of the opening to cover the feces and used toilet paper; this absorbs moisture and neutralises odours.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Does it smell?</summary>
      <p>Odours only develop when urine and solids mix; the Mini’s separation system prevents mixing, and the added absorbent material neutralises any remaining moisture and smells.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What do I do with used toilet paper? Do I need special paper?</summary>
      <p>Dispose of used toilet paper as usual by placing it at the back of the opening. You don’t need special paper; regular toilet paper is biodegradable and compostable.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How do I empty the unit and how often?</summary>
      <p>The unit opens from the back so you can remove the solids container. Once it’s full, close it hermetically and let it sit for at least six months to finish decomposition.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What should I do with the waste? Do I need a special composter?</summary>
      <p>After composting, you can empty the container into a closed compost bin. A closed composter prevents odours and rainwater infiltration. Allow the compost to mature for over 24 months to ensure hygiene; the resulting humus can be used as fertilizer in your garden. Urine can be diluted with water and used as liquid fertilizer.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is it hygienic? How do I clean the unit?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Users only touch the seat just like a conventional toilet. The containers are airtight and leak‑proof, so they can be transported without spills. Because solids go directly into the container, cleaning is simpler and required less often.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Where can I install the Mini? Do I need a building permit?</summary>
      <p>There are no general regulations limiting where you can install it, and the system doesn’t produce leachate or blackwater. Customers usually don’t need building permits for our outdoor models, but you should check with your local municipality.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Will I see solids when I open the toilet?</summary>
      <p>No. The solids container is black and light doesn’t reach it; because you always add toilet paper and absorbent material last, you’ll only see the covering material.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What if urine isn’t completely separated?</summary>
      <p>The design ensures nothing spills; any urine that isn’t diverted simply flows into the solids container, and small amounts don’t cause problems.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What about menstruation?</summary>
      <p>Using the Mini during menstruation is no problem; menstrual stains can be cleaned easily, and the small amount of blood doesn’t affect composting. However, pads or similar items shouldn’t be placed in the containers if you plan to compost.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How long does it take to set up? Do I need water or electricity?</summary>
      <p>The Mini arrives flat‑packed and can be assembled in minutes. It operates completely off‑grid and requires no plumbing or electricity.</p>
